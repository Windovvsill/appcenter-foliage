## Switch between apps in Appcenter

When you have multiple apps in Appcenter that have the same resources, like apps/app_name/builds/branches/dev or apps/app_name/distribute/code-push/Production, there is no easy way to move between apps because Appcenter is not aware of the resource parity.

Since the URLs are the same except for the app_name, a button can be added to move to the same resource in a different app.
